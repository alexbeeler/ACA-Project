# ACA-Project
Project for Code Louisville Python/SQL Course Summer 2019.

In this project, I collected data on the Affordable Care Act law that went into place in 2010. The goal of this project is to answer the question: What percent did the uninsured rate of people drop on avaerage in the US? What were the top 5 states with the highest uninsured rate drop? WHat were the bottom 5 states with the lowest uninsured rate drop? What state had the biggest change in insurance coverage from 2010 to 2015? What state had the highest average monthly tax credit in 2016?

I visualized my results using Seaborn.
